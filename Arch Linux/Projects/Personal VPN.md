When I'm in school and using the school's network, some sites are blocked and I hate that. Therefore I decided to use the resources I had and create a personal vpn.

I have a rocky linux mini pc at home so I decided to use that as our vpn server. Here are the steps I am going to take in order to create this shit.

1. Install WireGuard on my Rocky Linux Server
2. Configure the server as VPN endpoint
3. Generate encrytion keys
4. Set up server networking and firewall rules
5. Create client configurations for my client machines
6. Test the connection
7. Verify website access through VPN
